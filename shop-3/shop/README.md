These scripts are used to initialize or destroy the objects of the shop example. See the 
AMIS-Blog-AWS/shop-1 directory for pdf's of the blogs about the shop example, or go to 
https://technology.amis.nl and search for it.

Advise: use Vagrant to create a VM and use the `init-all.sh` script in the home directory 
of the vagrant user to deploy the objects.
