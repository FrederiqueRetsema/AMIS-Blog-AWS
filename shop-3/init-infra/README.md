# AMIS-Blog-AWS/shop-3/init-infra

These scripts are used to create infrastructural objects for the shop example for the blogs about the shop in AWS. 
See the shop-1 directory of this repository to see a pdf of the blogs, or go to https://technology.amis.nl to search for it.

When you want to initialize an environment yourself, please use the vagrant directory to create a VM and
use the scripts from within the VM.
