# AMIS-Blog-AWS/shop-2/tests

These scripts are used to create the test objects for the AWS shop example project. See the AMIS-Blog-AWS/shop-2 directory
for a pdf of the blogs about this subject or go to https://technology.amis.nl and search for it.

Advise: use Vagrant to create a VM and use the `init-all.sh` script in the home directory of the 
vagrant user to deploy the objects.
