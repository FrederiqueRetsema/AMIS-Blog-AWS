# AMIS-Blog-AWS/shop-1

This part of the repository contains the scripts and programs to setup your own environment to get the example shop that was written about in the AMIS technology blog (https://technology.amis.nl). 
The test of that blog can be read in this directory.

When you want to play along with the blogs, go to the vagrant directory and read the README.md file.
